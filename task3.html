            <h2>Hello, I'm <span>Miracle Igboanusi</span> and this is My Tech Journey</h2>
            <p>I have always wanted to study <span><b>Computer Science</b></span> since senior secondary school days, but due to lack confidence and the fear of staying at home for too long, i have to change my course of study even though i did so well in my jamb. Now as a graduated i've decided to go back to the vision.</p>
            <p>So i official started my tech journey in 2025 with a passion for <span><b>FrondEnd Development</b></span>. Over time, I've explored HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and many more tools in which i have used to make couple of website. It's been challenging, exciting, and rewarding!</p>
